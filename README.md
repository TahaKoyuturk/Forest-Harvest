# 🌲 Forest Harvest – Idle Adventure

**Forest Harvest** is an arcade idle game developed in **Unity** using the **PlayWorks** platform.  
The project began as a small experiment but grew into a complete gameplay loop featuring resource collection, zone unlocking, and progression-based building mechanics.

This repository highlights my ability to build game systems, optimize performance, and continuously learn new tools and workflows.

## 🎮 Gameplay Overview

- **Wood Collection System**  
  Players gather wood from trees. Each collected log jumps toward the player using a parabolic DOTween animation and stacks precisely on the character.

- **Coin & Progression Loop**  
  Wood converts into coins, unlocking new areas and allowing players to expand their forest.

- **Zone Building System**  
  Certain areas require a specific amount of wood. When completed, the zone activates with a bounce animation and becomes part of the player's base.

- **Smooth Animation Feedback**  
  Includes pop effects, scale animations, dynamic stacking, and UI updates to enhance player feedback.

- **Performance-Friendly Flow**  
  Startup and heavy operations are spread over multiple frames to reduce `ExecuteTasks()` and overall load.
